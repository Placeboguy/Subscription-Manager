# Why Yearly Spending Shows $0.00

## The Answer
You don't have any subscriptions with `Frequency: Yearly`

Your current subscriptions are all **Monthly**:
- Netflix: $15.99/month
- Spotify: $4.01/month
- Total: $20.00/month

---

## How Stats Work

### Monthly Spending = Sum of all "monthly" subscriptions
```
Netflix $15.99 (monthly) ✓
Spotify $4.01 (monthly) ✓
Result: $20.00
```

### Yearly Spending = Sum of all "yearly" subscriptions
```
(no yearly subscriptions)
Result: $0.00 ✓ This is correct!
```
